# About this Electronic Book
This electronic book (e-book) is a collection of free, online curriculum-tied notebooks designed by the [Callyso project](https://callysto.ca). 

The notebooks listed in this e-book are built using Jupyter notebook technology – a free, online software platform where you can use or share live code. 

## E-book purpose
The purpose of this e-book is to help Grades 5-12 teachers search for, or browse through curriculum notebooks which best suit their classroom. 

Because the e-book is designed for browsing purposes, the code within the notebooks does not fully function. See the section below to learn now to use the notebooks.
