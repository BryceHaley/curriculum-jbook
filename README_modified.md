# About the Notebooks
This Jupyter Book is a compilation of Juputer notebooks with curriculum content developed by the team of Callysto developers in 2017-2020. These notebooks are designed to help teachers bring computational thinking into their math, science, social sciences, and humanities courses. 

## Getting Started

You can browse through the sections of this eBook to see what is in the content of various notebooks. However, this book is **not functional** as the code within does not actually run. Certain animations and videos are active, but there is no computational kernel to actually activate the code.

To use any notebook, you will need to sign in to the Callysto hub, which can be as simple as clicking the link at the top of each notebook. Or you can follow these instructions.

## Using live notebooks on Callysto

Sign in to the [Callysto Hub](https://hub.callysto.ca) and start your server in the cloud. Accounts are free. You may use your Google ID or Microsoft identities to create your accoutn. 

There is a startup file to get you going. 

## Built With

* [Callysto](http://callysto.ca) - A CanCode-funded project for digitial literacy. 

* [Syzygy](http://syzygy.ca) - Proviings access to supercomputing resources and cloud hosting of notebooks.
