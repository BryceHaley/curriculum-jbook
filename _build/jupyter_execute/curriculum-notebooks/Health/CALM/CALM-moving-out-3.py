### Moving Expenses
üìöThere are one-time moving expenses to consider. Follow the instructions in the code cell below to edit the numbers, then run the cell to calculate and store your expenses.

#‚úèÔ∏è
# If you plan to have a roommate, change this to a 1 instead of a 0
roommate = 0

# Security Deposit or Damage Deposit: this is usually equal to one month's rent.
#  You can get your deposit back when you move out, if you take care of your home.
#  Some landlords also charge a non-refundable pet fee.
damageDeposit = 0
petFee = 0

# If you plan to have a pet, estimate the cost of the pet, toys, furniture, etc.
petPurchase = 1000

# There are sometimes utility activation or hookup costs
electricalActivation = 10
naturalGasActivation = 10
waterActivation = 0
internetActivation = 0
mobilePhoneActivitation = 25

mobilePhonePurchase = 300

furnitureAndAppliances = 500

movingCosts = 300


# üìö You've finished editing numbers, now run the cell to calculate and store expenses

if roommate == 1:
    movingExpenses = (
        damageDeposit + 
        electricalActivation + 
        naturalGasActivation + 
        waterActivation + 
        internetActivation + 
        furnitureAndAppliances
        ) / 2 + mobilePhoneActivitation + mobilePhonePurchase + movingCosts + petFee + petPurchase
else:
    movingExpenses = (
        damageDeposit +
        electricalActivation + 
        naturalGasActivation + 
        waterActivation + 
        internetActivation + 
        furnitureAndAppliances + 
        mobilePhoneActivitation + 
        mobilePhonePurchase + 
        movingCosts + 
        petFee + 
        petPurchase
        )

%store roommate
%store movingExpenses
print('Moving expenses will be about $' + str(movingExpenses))
