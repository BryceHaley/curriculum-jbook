# CALM - Moving Out 2
## Part 2 - Income

üìóNow let's take a look at your potential income. First, some definitions:

### Paycheque Definitions
#### Gross Income (pay/earnings)
The amount of income/earnings, for any pay period, before deductions
 
#### Net income (pay/earnings)
The amount of income/earnings, for any pay period, after deductions (Take home pay)

#### CPP - Canada Pension Plan
2.3% of gross income deducted for insurance in case of unemployment
 
#### Income Tax
A deduction paid to the Federal and Provincial government for taxes
 
#### LTD
A deduction for Long Term Disability insurance
 
#### Union Dues
Fees paid for membership in a union
 
#### Bonds
An investment in which a business or government pays a set interest rate
 
#### Advance Earnings
Deducted money that was received in advance of the pay cheque
 
#### Overtime Earnings
Pay received for working over 8 hours a day or 44 hours a week, whichever is greater

### Calculating Net Income

üìóClick on the code cell below, then click the `Run` button on the toolbar to calculate your net income. You may also change some values in the code to see how the results change.

#‚úèÔ∏è
wagePerHour = 15  # this is your wage in $/hour
hoursPerDay = 8
workdaysPerMonth = 21

grossIncome = wagePerHour * hoursPerDay * workdaysPerMonth
print('Your gross income is $', grossIncome, 'per month.')

incomeTax = .15 + .10   # assume federal income tax is 15% and provincial is 10%
cpp = .0495             # assume Canada Pension Plan is 4.95%
ei = .0188              # assume Employment Insurance is 1.88%
unionDues = .0075       # 0.75% sounds reasonable for union dues

deductions = grossIncome * (incomeTax + cpp + ei + unionDues)
print('$', '{:.2f}'.format(deductions), ' will be taken off your paycheck.')

netIncome = grossIncome - deductions
print('Your net income is $', '{:.2f}'.format(netIncome), 'per month.')
%store netIncome        # store that value in memory for later notebooks

## Graphing Income
üìó
We can also look at how your net income (take-home pay) changes based on your hourly wage. We will use [2019 taxation rates](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/frequently-asked-questions-individuals/canadian-income-tax-rates-individuals-current-previous-years.html) as well as [EI](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/employment-insurance-ei/ei-premium-rates-maximums.html) and [CPP](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/payroll-deductions-contributions/canada-pension-plan-cpp/cpp-contribution-rates-maximums-exemptions.html) rates. `Run` the cell below (without editing it) to generate a graph.

    xaxis=go.layout.XAxis(title=go.layout.xaxis.Title(text='Hourly Wage')),
    yaxis=go.layout.YAxis(title=go.layout.yaxis.Title(text='Income')))

üìóThe graph shows that the difference between gross income and net income (after deductions) increases as wage increases. For more information about this, you may want to read about [progressive taxation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax).
